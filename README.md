Download the VM from releases. To run the server, login with root/password and run `./JitStreamer.sh`

The VM also includes a script `sh update.sh` which should update to their latest versions if needed.

If the scripts show up blank for whatever reason, you can redownload them using curl:

`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jawshoeadan/AlpineJitVM/refs/heads/main/JitStreamer.sh`
`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jawshoeadan/AlpineJitVM/refs/heads/main/update.sh`
